This project is a sample project. It is a RESTful API built using Spring 4. It talks to a MySql database using Spring Data JPA using Hibernate as an ORM provider. It is secured using signed JSON Web Tokens (JWS) and Spring Security. 

This project was built using Intelli-J Idea, which can be found here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/. The diagrams were built using the community edition of Visual Paradigm, which can be found here: https://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp. 

This project was built for my own education, and also as a future reference to RESTful web services using Spring 4.
