This project is a sample project. It is a RESTful API built using Spring 4. It talks to a MySql database using Spring Data JPA using Hibernate as an ORM provider. It is secured using signed JSON Web Tokens (JWS) and Spring Security. 

The schema for the database is included in the _'database'_ folder. This schema also contains some insert statements to add dummy data to the database.

There is full generated javadoc documentation contained in the documentation folder, along with a _visual paradigm_ project.

This project was built using [Intelli-J Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). The diagrams were built using the community edition of [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp). 

This project was built for my own education, and also as a future reference to RESTful web services using Spring 4.
